Mostly just an exercise in AngularJS, but it's a fantasy football draft tool.  

Todo
===
- styling
- local storage?
- find $ values?
- track other teams or just yourself and available?
- enforce/recommend positions (must have 1 QB, 1 K, 2 RBs, etc)
- sort by any column
    - back to default sorting (position then positionrank)
