Mostly just an exercise in AngularJS, but it's a fantasy football draft tool.  

Todo
===
- styling
- local storage?
- find $ values for bidding?
- add team rankings (just averages of overall rankings - Steve has best team, Renee 2nd, etc.)
- add positional rankings (just averages of positional rankings - Steve has 4th best DEF, 9th best QB, etc.)
- enforce/recommend positions (must have 1 QB, 1 K, 2 RBs, etc)
- sort by any column
    - back to default sorting (position then positionrank)
- maybe collapse entire positions?
- collapse other coach's tables?
